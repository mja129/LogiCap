LogicAp is a fully functional logic simulator developed as part of the CS1980 course at the University of Pittsburgh from Spring 2025–Spring 2026.

## Contributors 🤝

This project was designed and built by:

- **Sean Shmulevich**  
  - Architecture and integration
- **Joseph Secosky**  
  - Circuit "Backend", DevOps
- **Mason McGinnis**  
  - Full-stack, frontend-focused
- **Gabriel Schmidt**  
- **Matthew Anderson**  
  - Wire grid overhaul
- **Ezra Cheifetz**  
  - Hardcoded subcircuits (Plexers) & scrollbar
- **Carson Gollinger**  
  - Signal propagation overhaul
- **William Waite**
  - Created 9 components & Multi-bit wires & sim speed
## Why is it called LogicAp? 🤔
The name *LogicAp* is derived from the combination of "Logic" and "Capstone," highlighting that this project started as our senior capstone project.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Svelte** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build and bundle
- **TypeScript** - Programming language
- **DigitalJS** (npm lib) - Logic gate simulation library ([GitHub](https://github.com/tilk/digitaljs))
